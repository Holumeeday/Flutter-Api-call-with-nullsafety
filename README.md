## Getting With Started Api With NullSafety

 API reference.
 How do APIs Work?
 A user application can contact any database through HTTP requests. 
 So, we can create GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE HTTP requests to a database. 
 In return, the database sends us data or results or responses in form of JSON or HTML or XML. 
 The JSON format is widely used. 
 We then parse the JSON into a proper model class and use it in our app.
